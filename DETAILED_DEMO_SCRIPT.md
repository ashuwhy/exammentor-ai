# ExamMentor AI - "Action Era" Winning Demo Script (3 Minutes)

> **Goal:** Showcase true agentic autonomy (Action Era), self-correction, and multimodal reasoning in under 3 minutes.
> **Theme:** "Not just a wrapper, but an autonomous agent that plans, corrects, and sees."

## 🎥 Pre-Recording Checklist (Do this first!)
1.  **Mock Data Injection:**
    *   **Plan Diff:** Ensure you have a plan generation result where v1 misses a topic (e.g., "Evolution") and v2 fixes it, ready to display in `PlanDiff.tsx`.
    *   **Image Quiz:** Have a biology diagram (e.g., chloroplast/photosynthesis) ready on your desktop.
    *   **Misconception:** Know exactly which question you will answer wrong to trigger the "Vibe Check".
2.  **Screen Setup:**
    *   Clean browser window (no bookmarks bar).
    *   Resolution: 1080p minimum.
    *   **Zoom Tool Ready:** Prepare to zoom in on the "Plan Diff" text.

## 🎬 The Script

### 0:00 - 0:30 | The Hook: "Action Era" & Autonomy
**Objective:** Hit the hackathon theme immediately. Define the problem (passive AI) and the solution (Agentic AI).

| Time | Visual Action (Screen) | Voiceover Script |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0:00** | **[Homepage]** Cursor hovers over "Start Autopilot Mode". Click it. | "What if your AI tutor wasn't just a chatbot waiting for a prompt, but an agent that *acted*?" |
| **0:05** | **[Autopilot Dashboard]** Click **"Start Autonomous Session"**. | "This is ExamMentor AI, built for the Gemini 3 'Action Era'." |
| **0:10** | **[Autopilot Log]** Show the log streaming rapidly: <br> `Thinking...` <br> `Selecting Topic: Cell Biology` <br> `Reasoning: User weakness detected in previous session.` | "Instead of you managing the AI, it manages your learning. Watch here—I click once, and it decides the topic based on my history..." |
| **0:20** | **[Autopilot Log]** Log updates: <br> `Action: Generating Quiz` <br> `Action: Verifying difficulty` | "...it drafts a quiz, verifies the difficulty, and prepares the session. It's orchestrating the workflow, not just answering text." |

### 0:30 - 1:15 | The "Money Shot": Visual Proof of Self-Correction
**Objective:** Show *Plan v1 → v2*. This proves the "Eval-Optimize" loop.

| Time | Visual Action (Screen) | Voiceover Script |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0:30** | **[Navigation]** Click "Create Plan". Select "NEET Exam", "7 Days". Click **"Generate"**. | "But autonomy is dangerous without verification. That's why we built a self-correcting Planner Agent." |
| **0:40** | **[Plan Loading]** Show a loading state (speed up in post-edit). | "Most AIs give you the first draft. We don't." |
| **0:45** | **[Plan Result]** The plan appears. **STOP** and click the **"Show Self-Correction Log"** toggle/tab. | "Look at this. The Agent generated Plan V1..." |
| **0:50** | **[ZOOM IN 200%]** Focus on the red/green diff text. <br> **Red:** "Missing key topic: Biotechnology" <br> **Green:** "Added: Principles of Biotechnology (Day 4)" | "...the Evaluator Agent caught a missing topic—Biotechnology—and rejected it. It autonomously looped back to generate Plan V2." |
| **1:05** | **[Plan Result]** Zoom out. Scroll down the final, correct plan. | "You're seeing the AI fix its own mistakes before you even see the result. That is true agentic reliability." |

### 1:15 - 2:00 | Multimodal "Citation" & Deep Understanding
**Objective:** Show the AI "seeing" specific parts of an image, not just generic OCR.

| Time | Visual Action (Screen) | Voiceover Script |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1:15** | **[Learn Page]** Click "Upload Diagram". Select `photosynthesis.png`. | "We also moved beyond text-only RAG. Let's look at Multimodal learning." |
| **1:25** | **[Image Quiz]** The image loads. The AI generates questions *next* to it. | "I upload a complex biology diagram. Gemini Pro doesn't just read the text labels." |
| **1:35** | **[Quiz Interaction]** Hover over a question like *"What is the function of the structure indicated by the top-right arrow?"* | "It understands spatial relationships. Look at this question—it's referencing a specific arrow in the diagram without text labels." |
| **1:50** | **[Quiz Interaction]** Click the answer. A success toast appears: "Correct! The thylakoid membrane..." | "This allows for visual critiques and diagram-based testing that purely textual models simply cannot do." |

---

### 2:00 - 2:40 | The "Vibe Check": Misconception Buster
**Objective:** Turn a standard quiz feature into a unique "aha!" moment about human psychology.

| Time | Visual Action (Screen) | Voiceover Script |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2:00** | **[Quiz Page]** Intentionally click the **WRONG** answer on a tricky logic question. | "Finally, let's talk about failure. Standard apps just say 'Incorrect'. We go deeper." |
| **2:10** | **[Result Card]** Click the button: **"Why did I get this wrong? (Vibe Check)"** | "I got this wrong, but instead of the answer, I ask the Agent for a 'Vibe Check'." |
| **2:15** | **[Misconception Modal]** A modal pops up. <br> **Title:** "Underlying Confusion Detected" <br> **Text:** "You're confusing *Osmosis* with *Diffusion*. Here's why..." | "The Agent analyzes my wrong answer to diagnose the *root cause*—my misconception. It realizes I'm confusing Osmosis with Diffusion." |
| **2:25** | **[Misconception Modal]** Click **"Try Redemption Question"**. A new question appears tailored to that specific confusion. | "It instantly generates a counter-example and a 'Redemption Question' to verify I've unlearned the bad habit." |

### 2:40 - 3:00 | Closing & Impact
**Objective:** Recap the tech stack and the "Action Era" theme.

| Time | Visual Action (Screen) | Voiceover Script |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2:40** | **[Results Dashboard]** Show the "Knowledge Graph" or "Progress Bar" filling up. | "We track these misconceptions over time to build a personalized mastery profile." |
| **2:50** | **[Tech Stack Slide]** Show a clean slide with logos: **Gemini 1.5 Pro**, **Next.js**, **FastAPI**, **Supabase**. | "ExamMentor AI. Orchestration, Self-Correction, and Multimodal reasoning. Powered by Gemini 3. This is the Action Era." |
| **3:00** | **[Fade to Black]** | (End of video) |

## 🛠 Production Notes
*   **Audio:** Record in a closet or use Adobe Podcast Enhance. Crisp audio is 50% of the grade.
*   **Pacing:** Don't rush the voiceover. If the video is too long, cut the "loading" animations, not the explanation.
*   **Zooming:** The "Plan Diff" (0:50) is the most important shot. Make sure the text is readable on a mobile screen.
