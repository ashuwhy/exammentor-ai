## Video Outline

### 0:00 - 0:30 | Hook + Autopilot Demo Start (30 sec)

**VISUALS**: Open ExamMentor AI homepage showing "Action Era Features"

**SCRIPT**:
> "What if your AI tutor could teach itself—picking topics, adapting to your mistakes, and running 30-minute learning sessions without you clicking anything?"
>
> "This is ExamMentor AI, built for Gemini 3's **Action Era**—where AI doesn't just respond, it *orchestrates*."

**ACTION**: 
- Click "Autopilot Mode" button
- Show the "Start Autopilot" screen briefly
- Click "Start Autopilot (5 min demo)"

**SHOW**: The run log starts populating with AI decisions:
- "Session Started"
- "Topic Selected: Cell Biology" with reasoning

### 0:30 - 1:15 | Self-Correcting Plan Generation (45 sec)

**VISUALS**: Navigate back, go to Onboarding

**SCRIPT**:
> "Let me show you what happens behind the scenes when we generate a study plan."

**ACTION**:
- Select NEET exam
- Set 7-day goal
- Watch plan generation with self-correction

**SHOW** (Key Moment):
- Plan v1 generated
- Verification shows: "Missing topics: Evolution, Biotechnology"
- AI self-corrects → v2 generated
- "Self-Correction Log" panel expanded showing the diff

**SCRIPT**:
> "The AI didn't just generate a plan—it **verified** it, found gaps, and **fixed itself**. 
> No human intervention. That's self-correction in action."

### 1:15 - 2:00 | Multimodal Diagram Quiz (45 sec)

**VISUALS**: Go to Learn page, upload a biology diagram

**SCRIPT**:
> "Multimodal isn't optional here—it's central."

**ACTION**:
- Upload a photosynthesis diagram
- Click "Generate Quiz from Diagram"

**SHOW** (Key Moment):
- AI describes what it sees in the image
- Quiz questions appear with visual references:
  - "Looking at the chloroplast in the center..."
  - "The arrows in the top-left showing electron flow indicate..."

**SCRIPT**:
> "These questions **reference specific visual elements**. 
> A text-only model couldn't answer them. This is real multimodal reasoning."

---

### 2:00 - 2:30 | Misconception Busting (30 sec)

**VISUALS**: Take a quiz, intentionally get one wrong

**SCRIPT**:
> "When you get a question wrong, we don't just show the answer."

**SHOW**:
- "The Underlying Confusion: You confused active transport with..."
- Counter-example explanation
- Redemption question

**SCRIPT**:
> "We diagnose **why** you were confused, give a counter-example that breaks your logic, 
> and a redemption question to verify you've cleared the misconception."

### 2:30 - 2:50 | Results + Mastery Trajectory (20 sec)

**VISUALS**: Navigate to Results page

**SHOW**:
- Overall score
- Topic performance bars
- "Areas to Improve" with misconceptions

## Key Points to Hit (Judge Checklist)

1. **"What happens autonomously?"** 
   → Autopilot run log showing AI decisions without clicks

2. **"Where did it self-correct?"**
   → Plan v1 → v2 diff with verification metrics

3. **"Show multimodal reasoning affecting the output"**
   → Diagram quiz with "In the top-left section..." references

---

## Recording Tips

- Use screen recording with 1080p or higher
- Zoom in on key UI elements (run log steps, self-correction panel)
- Keep mouse movements smooth and intentional
- Pre-load any images you'll upload for the diagram quiz
- Consider adding background music (low volume, no vocals)
- Use zoom/spotlight effects on critical moments

---

## Backup Demo Data

If live API is slow during recording:
1. Have a pre-generated plan with self-correction history saved
2. Have a pre-loaded autopilot session with steps
3. Have a pre-generated image quiz ready
